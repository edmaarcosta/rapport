## Installation

The package can be installed
by adding `rapport` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rapport, "~> 0.4"}
  ]
end
```

## Hello world

```elixir
page_template = "<h1><%= @hello %></h1>"
html_report =
  Rapport.new
  |> Rapport.add_page(page_template, %{hello: "Hello world!"})
  |> Rapport.generate_html
```

The snippet above generates a report containing only one page with a heading that says "Hello world!".
